r"""The read hook's out-of-project guard must not treat a rooted-but-driveless
path as cwd-relative.

`_run_hook_guard` short-circuits on `not Path(v).is_absolute()` with the comment
"relative -> anchored at cwd == in project". On Windows that premise is false for
a path like `/somewhere/else/x.py`: it has no drive, so `is_absolute()` is False,
but Windows anchors it at the current DRIVE root, not at cwd —
`Path("/somewhere/else/x.py").resolve()` is `C:\somewhere\else\x.py`. The guard
therefore declared out-of-project files in-project and emitted the read nudge,
and in strict mode the once-per-session deny, for files the graph never indexed.
`tests/test_hook_strict.py::test_out_of_project_read_silenced` has been failing
on Windows for exactly this reason.

`C:x.py` is the mirror case: drive-relative, anchored at that drive's current
directory rather than cwd.

The classification tests below drive `_is_cwd_relative` with `os.name` forced, so
the Windows semantics are exercised on POSIX CI too (`PureWindowsPath` works on
any host). The end-to-end tests need a real Windows `Path` flavour to show the
difference, so those are gated.
